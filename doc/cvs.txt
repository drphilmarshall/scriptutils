Using CVS
*********
 
                                                                                
i) For the first time:
 
In the directory in which you want the scriptutils module to appear as a
directory:

> cvs -d:pserver:XXX@kipac.stanford.edu:/a9/cvs login
> cvs -d:pserver:XXX@kipac.stanford.edu:/a9/cvs co scriptutils

"co" stands for "checkout". All cvs commands may be followed by the option
"-d" followed by the name of the CVS repository (cvsroot directory). This
will give you an scriptutils directory with all the desired contents, plus a
directory called "CVS" in each of its subdirectories. In each of these CVS
directories there is a file called "Root" containing the location of the
repository, so that when working in the scriptutils directory tree you do not
need the -d option.

 
ii) To get the latest version of the code:
 
In the subdirectory you want to update:
 
> cvs update
 
For example, to ensure all files are up to date, do this from the scriptutils
directory itself. CVS will then recursively move through the file tree comparing
the contents of your scriptutils directory with that of the scriptutils module
in the repository. Comments are supplied to show you whereabouts in the tree CVS
has got to, e.g.

cvs update: Updating src
                                                                                
Where there is a mismatch, CVS prints the offending filename with a letter next
to it:
                                                                                
M file.txt .................. You have Modified file.txt so that it doesn't
                              match the repository file.txt
                               
U file.txt .................. Someone else has modified file.txt, so CVS has
                              Updated your copy using that in the repository
                                                                                
P file.txt .................. Someone else has modified file.txt, so CVS has
                              Patched your copy using that in the repository,
                              and may have done it wrongly...

C file.txt .................. Both you and someone else have modified file.txt,
                              and CVS cannot merge the two together (in which
                              case you would get a "U" label) - a Conflict has
                              occurred. What you get is a (non-compilable) file
                              with BOTH sets of modifications in it, which you
                              have to edit in order to merge both sets of
                              changes sensibly. You may have to interact with
                              your co-workers at this point!

                                                                                
iii) To include your modifications into the package:
                                                                                
To add the file "file.txt" to the repository:
                                                                                
> cvs add file.txt
                                                                                
This labels your local copy of "file.txt" such that when you run
                                                                                
> cvs commit file.txt
                                                                                
the file is added to the repository. Likewise, to remove a file from the
repository, do
                                                                                
> cvs remove file.txt
> cvs commit file.txt
                                                                                
Simply updating the repository with your modified (already existing) file.txt
is done with

> cvs commit file.txt
                                                                                
Whenever you commit a change to a file, you'll be given an editor (as
specified by your $EDITOR environment variable) in which to enter your
comments. Don't include your userid, the date or the time, CVS will
include this automatically. Extreme code should be self-documenting, so 
keep your comments short - best of all is to use the "-m" option:

> cvs ci -m "Ellipticity prior bug fixed" file.txt
                                                                                
You can then read this and all the other comments for that file by doing
                                                                                
> cvs log file.txt
                                                                                
which prints the history of the file, most recent changes first. Note that 
"ci" is short for "commit" or "check-in".
                                                                                
IMPORTANT - for the sanity of all involved it is best if you only submit code
that you know at least compiles! If you can rigorously test it locally as well
then so much the better.


iv) Stable versions

When, collectively, it has been decided that a stable version has been
reached, a set of files can be "tagged" for future reference. For example,
to tag the files at th epoint we make the repository available to the whole
world:

$ cvs tag release .

The to recover the released version, do (somewhere else)

$ cvs co -r release scriptutils



v) What not to do:

- Check in code that does not compile
- Keep large data files, executables, libraries etc in the repository: 
these should be generated by the code locally, or obtained from elsewhere 
in the case of data.
- Create any directories without consulting the rest of the team.
- Go for long periods of time without a cvs update!


vi) How was the scriptutils repository set up?

Our sysadmin created a cvs repository called "cvs" in the /a9/ directory on the
machine answering to the name "kipac.stanford.edu". The command to do this would
have been something like

$ cvs -d /a9/cvs init

The scriptutils module was then added to the repository using the import command:

$ cd scriptutils
$ cvs -d:pserver:pjm@kipac.stanford.edu:/a9/cvs import \
-m "Imported sources" scriptutils scriptutils start

The arguments after the comment are
1) The desired module name, in which the contents of the cwd are placed
2) A vendor tag, which is required but has little meaning or for people like us
3) A release tag, which again is largely for internal use but has to be there
